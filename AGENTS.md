# Muckwire

## Overview
Repo for an **autonomous overnight investigative research agent** that runs on a Mac workstation, uses LM Studio for local model work and OpenRouter for cloud synthesis by default, and persists research as markdown + SQLite. The Python package (`research_agent`, CLI `research`) has a functional v1 CLI/daemon baseline: intake, job lifecycle, planner loop, connector dispatch, synthesis/critique, experimental section-fragment synthesis/critique, search, export, compare, source dedupe, checkpoint resume, report history, scope-aware replanning, cornerstone-document indexing/querying, opt-in translation, live inbox ingest, structured table artifacts/CSV enrichment, working hypotheses, enumeration coverage ledgers, and confirmed-gap reporting are in-tree. Connector depth, open-archive coverage, MCP/service surfaces, and long-run quality are still expanded issue-by-issue via alpha-loop. The top-level `*.md` playbooks remain strategic source material and project deliverables. Output of this work feeds the broader `Alpha*` agent ecosystem.

## Tech Stack
- Language: **Python 3.12+** (typed, async-first; no TypeScript at the core)
- Agent framework: **Pydantic AI** + a thin custom orchestrator (no LangGraph in v1)
- CLI: **Typer** commands, **Rich** status/progress rendering, **Questionary** interactive intake; entry point `research = "research_agent.cli:app"` and `python -m research_agent` via `__main__.py`
- CLI surface: `research start`, `list`, `status`, `view`, `search`, `stop`, `resume`, `logs`, `export`, `compare`, `doctor`, `research inbox <job-id> add/list`, and `research config cache-clear`
- Storage: **SQLite** in WAL mode at `data/index.sqlite` for jobs, tasks, plans, checkpoints, events, sources, findings, syntheses, critiques, fragments, fragment critiques, hypotheses, coverage units, FTS5, embeddings, completion reasons, and LLM call ledger; separate `data/llm_cache.sqlite` for wipeable LLM cache; markdown, JSON, JSONL, and CSV sidecars for per-job content
- Model providers: **LM Studio** at `http://localhost:1234/v1` for local tiers and embeddings; **OpenRouter** at `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` for cloud tiers. Logical tiers are `fast`, `general`, `reasoner`, `vision`, `embeddings`, `frontier`, `frontier_alt`, and `frontier_speed`; `config/models.local.yaml` maps every tier to LM Studio for `--local` runs.
- Sources/connectors: public-first in-tree connectors using `tools/models.py` (`SearchResult`, `Source`) plus direct-kind registration in `tools/_registry.py`: Playwright/DDG/Google/Brave web search, `web_fetch` via `httpx` + `trafilatura` + `readability-lxml`, Wayback + archive.today archival, arXiv, RSS/news, Reddit, local corpus/cornerstone retrieval, PDF/OCR/image/audio/YouTube, public records/disclosures (EDGAR, FEC, Congress, FedRegister, CourtListener, LDA, USAspending, GDELT, LittleSis, Nonprofits, OpenCorporates, Sanctions, BBB, SoS, Licensing, State Election, CalAccess, Scholar, LinkedIn), and open-archive/scholarly surfaces (LoC, NARA, DPLA, Europeana, Gallica, Commons, C-SPAN, Internet Archive, IWM, Trove, UKNA, Wikidata, Wikisource, OpenAlex, OpenLibrary, Persee, BNE, Smithsonian/`si_search`, HathiTrust fetch-only enrichment)
- Browser automation: shared Playwright session in `tools/browser.py`, reused by search/fetch and scrape connectors with host-level rate limits and diagnostics under `data/diagnostics/`
- Package manager: **uv** with committed `uv.lock`; `.venv/`, caches, runtime DBs, logs, jobs, and large artifacts stay gitignored

## Code Style
- **Read the implementation guide before designing anything new.** `research-agent-implementation-guide.md` locks the v1 decisions: Pydantic AI, SQLite queue, per-job folders, Typer CLI, model tiers, and source/sidecar contracts.
- **Per-job folder is self-contained.** A job lives under `jobs/<job-id>/` with `job.json`, `intake.json`, `goal.md`, `plan/`, `findings/`, `sources/`, `synthesis/`, `fragments/`, `critique/`, `artifacts/`, `coverage.json`, `inbox/processed/`, `report.md`, `report.history/`, `archive/`, `events.jsonl`, `daemon.pid`, `daemon.{out,err}.log`, transient `INBOX_REPLAN.json`/`RESUME_REPLAN.json`, and optional `STOP`.
- **Job starts are resumable/reusable.** `research start` soft-resets an existing goal-slug job by archiving prior `report.md` under `archive/`; `--fresh-reset` opts out and requires a clean folder.
- **Job IDs are deterministic and safe.** They use UTC `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>` from the goal, with slug validation in `storage/jobs.py`; do not bypass that constructor.
- **Markdown for content, JSON sidecars for metadata.** Findings, translations, plans, sources, syntheses, critiques, fragments, reports, exports, and artifacts must remain human-readable on disk and machine-indexable in SQLite where applicable.
- **Use atomic file writes.** Project writers use `*.tmp` + `os.replace`; new writers under job/data paths should follow the same pattern.
- **Type structured model outputs with Pydantic AI** (`output_type=MySchema`) and rely on schema retries rather than hand-parsing model text.
- **Prompts live in `src/research_agent/prompts/*.md`.** Persona, recipe, and reference behavior belongs in markdown, not embedded as Python string literals.
- **Runtime skills live in `src/research_agent/skills/{connectors,strategies}/*.md`.** Each skill needs YAML frontmatter with at least `description:`; planner sees descriptions, and the orchestrator deep-loads bodies only when relevant.
- **Direct connector kinds are registry-driven.** New planner-callable connectors register through `tools/_registry.py` and must be imported in `tools/__init__.py`; the planner prompt, orchestrator handlers, `research doctor`, and README direct-kind table all derive from that registry. Do not hand-maintain parallel connector allowlists.
- **Connector modules use `SearchResult`/`Source`.** Planner-callable connectors expose async `search()` and usually `fetch()`; fetch-only enrichers such as HathiTrust are explicit exceptions. Stash connector-specific fields in `.extras`/`.metadata`, enforce polite rate limits, update `SourceKind`, host dispatch in `web_fetch`, and connector skills as applicable.
- **Candidate roster work keeps source meanings distinct.** `fec_search kind=candidates_enumerate` is federal FEC-filed status, `state_election_search` is official state ballot/candidate-list status, and `sos_search` is business-entity filings.
- **Structured table artifacts live under `artifacts/`.** Use `storage/artifacts.py` schemas and `storage/enrichment.py` for imported CSVs, provenance, conflicts, and generated CSV/JSONL outputs; candidate roster rows default to the `candidates` artifact.
- **Coverage ledgers drive enumeration/list-building jobs.** Intake `enumeration` declares required units, `storage/coverage.py` mirrors `coverage_units` to `coverage.json`, and completion must account for complete, not-yet-public, or confirmed-gap units.
- **Inbox ingest is operator-supplied evidence.** `research inbox <job-id> add <file>` copies into `inbox/`; the daemon indexes files through `local_corpus`, moves them to `inbox/processed/<sha>-<name>`, emits `corpus_doc_added`, and writes `INBOX_REPLAN.json`.
- **Working hypotheses are a first-class ledger.** Synthesis can emit `hypothesis_updates`, stored through `storage/hypotheses.py` and surfaced by `research view <job-id> --hypotheses`.
- **Section-fragment synthesis is opt-in.** `research start --fragments` sets `RESEARCH_FRAGMENT_SYNTH=1`; report section IDs live in `orchestrator/fragments.py`, findings store `target_fragments`, fragment outputs write `fragments/<section>/<version>.{md,json}`, fragment critiques write under `critique/fragments/`, and `report.md` is deterministically assembled from latest fragments.
- **`web_fetch` is the URL router.** It handles robots checks, HTTP/readability extraction, Playwright fallback, PDF/audio/image/YouTube shortcuts before host dispatch, connector-owned URLs, and best-effort archive spawning.
- **Model routing is config-driven.** Business logic selects tiers (`general`, `frontier`, etc.); `config/models.yaml`, `config/models.local.yaml`, and `RESEARCH_MODELS_CONFIG` decide providers/models. Do not hardcode model names outside routing/config-specific code.
- **Cloud spend is explicit.** Normal LLM calls go through `Router` and `BudgetTracker` in `llm/budgets.py`; local-tier degradation fallbacks and PDF/OCR VLM escalations must be configured, visible in events, and budget-tracked or WARN-gated before the call.
- **Checkpoint every state transition.** The daemon must be resumable with `research resume <job-id>` from the latest checkpoint after a crash or kill; running tasks are reset to pending on restore.
- **Emit structured observability.** Tool calls, model calls, decisions, warnings, checkpoints, skill loads, fan-outs, synthesis mode, fragment updates, completion reasons, artifact/coverage diagnostics, and cap diagnostics append to `events.jsonl` and mirror into SQLite via `observability/events.py`.
- **Sources are deduped by content hash in SQLite and materialized per job.** `storage/sources.py` hashes cleaned content, links via `job_sources`, writes `sources/<sha256>.{md,json}` into the active job even on dedup hits, and rehydrates pruned files when refetched.
- **Cornerstone documents have a separate path.** Plans can declare `cornerstone_url`; large PDFs may trigger section-walk extraction, per-job chunk indexing as `cornerstone_chunk` sources with `parent_source_id`, and `cornerstone_query` follow-ups.
- **Planner depth controls are scope-aware.** `Plan.scope_class`, `active_strategies`, drain-replan caps, findings floors, `expand_top_k`, and second-order URL fan-out are coordinated in `orchestrator/loop.py`; preserve those guardrails when changing planner behavior.
- **Translation is opt-in.** `translate_non_english` belongs in job intake or task payload, writes `findings/NNNNNN.translation.md`, uses `frontier_speed`, and skips rather than exceeding budget.
- **Archive first-fetch URLs best-effort.** `web_fetch` spawns Wayback Save Page Now and falls back to archive.today; archive failures should warn, not fail the fetch.
- **Respect disk caps.** Writers under `jobs/` and `data/` must work with `storage/disk_cap.py`; pruning removes low-relevance source markdown but keeps audit rows.
- **Env vars are centrally registered.** New runtime keys belong in `config.py:EXPECTED_ENV_KEYS`, `.env.example`, README/API key docs as applicable, and should be read through `research_agent.config.get()`. `.env.local` and `.env` load via `config.load_env()`.
- **Naming:** snake_case modules, PascalCase Pydantic models, and verb-on-noun CLI subcommands mirroring `git` shape (`research start`, `research view`, `research config cache-clear`).
- **No root scratch docs.** Plans belong in GitHub issues/comments; long-form research belongs in the existing top-level playbooks. Do not add ad-hoc `NOTES.md`, `PLAN.md`, or similar files in the repo root.

## Non-Negotiables
- **GitHub Issues are the source of truth.** No work without an issue; PRs must close their issue (`Closes #N`). See `CLAUDE.md` for the alpha-loop workflow.
- **Never commit secrets or large artifacts.** `.env*` files except `.env.example`, API keys, model weights, `data/`, `jobs/`, `runs/`, `logs/`, `sessions/`, `models/`, `.worktrees/`, local alpha-loop session/auth state, and local corpus contents stay out of git unless deliberately promoted.
- **Outbound actions go through the judge gate.** Any task with `outbound: true` (email, FOIA, web form, voice) must wait for judge/human review; planner and workers must not dispatch outbound side effects directly.
- **SQLite uses WAL mode.** Do not disable WAL or foreign-key enforcement on the main index; concurrent CLI/UI readers and daemon writers depend on it.
- **No silent paid reroutes.** Cheap iterative work should stay on local tiers by default; any cloud fallback must be configured, visible in events, and budget-tracked. `--local` means all tiers use LM Studio and cloud health checks are skipped.
- **Do not break the per-job folder contract.** CLI commands, exports, comparisons, search, and future UIs read `jobs/<job-id>/` by convention.
- **Research playbooks are deliverables, not scratch.** Edit `ai-agent-investigation-playbook.md`, `ai-agent-research-setup.md`, and `research-agent-implementation-guide.md` only when the issue is about those artifacts.
- **No unapproved paid data APIs.** Prefer public/free APIs or Playwright recipes. Existing explicit paid/gated exceptions are OpenRouter, Scholar via SerpAPI, LinkedIn via Proxycurl/Lix, and env-gated OpenCorporates tokens; keep them documented, env-gated, and used only through explicit planner tasks.
